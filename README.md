The Evolution of Natural Competence: Disentangling Costs and Benefits of Sex in Bacteria

Authors: Danesh Moradigaravand and Jan Engelst√§dter

Many bacteria engage in a form of sexual recombination called transformation, in which they take up free DNA molecules from their environments and integrate them into their genomes. Here, I present a theoretical framework to analyze the interplay between different factors affecting physiological and genetic costs and benefits of transformation in determining the outcome of adaptation. The results reveal a complex relationship between
the benefits of transformation due the Fisher-Muller effect and nutritional value of the imported DNA on the one hand and potential costs of transformation that may originate from recombination with defective free DNA in the environment on the other hand in determining the evolution of transformation.
